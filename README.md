# Fit infinity ponies right in infinity rooms
### The short script about original infinity room hotel
[Hilbert Hotel](https://player.odycdn.com/api/v4/streams/free/pic_0/9e167c177f08531493c5c22d42aa6f336baa96b4/dfb2e8)

There is an infinity bus has infinity people, each one has an unique name constructed by infinity length of 'A' and 'B', and they infinity people want to host into Hilbert Hotel witch has infinity room.

But the hotel manager tells them hotel has no enough room for them, and make a list to show them why. Flip the first character of the first one's name and flip the second character of second one's name and so on, combine new fliped characters into a new name, and sthis new name won't appear on the list, so this one has no room.

### The method to fit infinity guest right in infinity room hotel
#### The understanding might be big wrong, comment to tell me please if you know me wrong
Still assuming is an infinity bus with infinity guest, and each guest has unique name like original one. Let 'A' represent number one, and 'B' represent number zero; And let first character place represent 2^0, the second character place represent 2^1, and so on. for example the "AABA" means number 11 in decimal. See pic below:

So we can rearrange infinity guest by their name represented number's size, and put them into infinity room one by one; As there geust with name BBBBBBBB... (infinity 'B') go to room_1 please, and the guest with name ABBBBBBB... (the infinity 'B' plus 'A') go to room_2, and the guest with name BABBBBBB... (the infinity 'B' plus 'A' twice) go to room_3, and so on. They host to infinity room one by one, and not hard to figure out the name that represents the largest number will go to the last room of infinity room hotel. This number is largest so this name must be full of infinity 'A' as AAAAAAAA... (infinity 'A'). If we make a list of new rearranged infinity guest, and flip their name's character one by one to generate new name that takes no room, as original Hilbert Hotel does; We will see this name will appear on the list, and this name appears on the last room of infinity room.

So all infinity name fit right in the infinity room. Right? Is my reasoning fallacy?
